### Hey you!

As I'm transitioning careers, I'm making my way through JS and React mostly. Every line of code is something new I learned!

As an Attorney, I got 5 years of experience and durring that time I had plenty of memories, learned a lot of stuff and surely made great collegues and I'm sure this new path will be as great as my time at law.

Feel free to connect and check my stuff around here!

Cheers!
